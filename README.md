# odin-signup-form
My first project in the Intermediate HTML and CSS course as part of the Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum.  

The aim of this project is to put into practice some of the recent skills I've learned regarding forms in HTML.  
  
This includes creating the forms themselves with appropriate form controls and styling them properly using CSS.  
  
My styling will involve the use of some pseudo-classes and maybe some pseudo-elements too.  
  
I also aim to demonstrate a good understanding of form validation.
